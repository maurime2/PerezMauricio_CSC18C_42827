Problem 6
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is:

				12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:

				(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural 
numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
natural numbers and the square of the sum.

				SUM n = n(n-1) / 2
				   x=1
 
				SUM n^2	= n(n+1)(2n+1) / 6
					x=1
