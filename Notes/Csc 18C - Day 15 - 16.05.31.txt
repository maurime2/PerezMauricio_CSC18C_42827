00:11:00	Going through Graph.java

			Dijkstara's Algorithm
			what is shortest path from a to g?

			a->c->d->g=9
			HCDBA

			temp = A B D C H G F E
			
			BREADTH FIRST SEARCH	-	uses a queue
			DEPTH FIRST SEARCH		- uses a stack
			
			addEdge(edge_collection,edge_name, source_vertex, destination_vertex, weight, directed);
	
00:21:00	true directed, false underected
			
00:36:40	visulazation - ITS LIKE A TREE

			AB - 5	BE - 6	CD - 3	DC
			AB - 4	BD - 4	CH - 6	.....
			
			
			final:
			20 questions: 
			
			- know about Bags and Collections
					traverse through them
					search through them
					clear a bag
					clear a bag with a linked list
					
			- know about Stacks
				Last In First Out (lifo).
				convert from infix to post fix.
				
00:45:21	- know about sorting/recursion
					knows dorting alg.
					activation records how it works with stacks.
						(EXTRA)
						recursive vs Iteration vs. Recursion

					FIFO - First in first out
					
			- Know about deque
					double ended queue
					
			- Linked List
					Efficiency
						efficency
						know operations
						
			- Doubly linked List
