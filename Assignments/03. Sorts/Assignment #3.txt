Implement in your Bag class, the Selection Sort and Merge Sort 
(10 points extra credit - implement a third sorting algorithm of your choice).

In all of the sorting algorithms you implement:
	- make sure to have them pass a boolean parameter that dictates the sorting order 
		(	true - sort in ascending order from smallest to largest, 
			false - sort in descending order from largest to smallest ).

	- Provide a main program, that is a test driver, demonstrating the sorting 
		algorithms working for Bags of String, Integers, and Float 
		( primitive types such as int and float, you need to use the their 
			respective wrapper classes Integer and Float ).

	- Be sure to document your code very well, and also provide your properly
		filled out PSP Excel Spreadsheet.

This assignment is due no later than 11:59PM on 4/8/16 for 50 points.
