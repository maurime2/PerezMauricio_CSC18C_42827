Big O Calculation:

At first it was a bit confusing to interprete the data seeing as how the 
default only displayed 10 instances of each function running. The First
thing I did is plot out 100 instances of each Function.

The first function only gave me 31 instances, seing as how it blew up in 
count at an exponential rate.
