Big O Calculation:

At first it was a bit confusing to interprete the data seeing as how the 
default only displayed 10 instances of each function running. The First
thing I did is plot out 100 instances of each Function.

The first function only gave me 31 instances, seing as how it blew up in 
count at an exponential rate. I then ploted theise values and verified 
that indeede it grew exponentialy. Upon seeing the counts, i was able to
actualy calculate the exact Big O formula. 2^n - 1. I say exact because of
all the formulas, this is the only one that gives me the exact count given
n.

The Second Formula was a bit trickyer. It grows just like the first one, 
but at half the rate or less. It is of exponential order 2^n but it dose not 
grow as fast. I say its more of the order (2*2^(ln n/ln 2)) - 1.

The Third is hard to see, but its of the order of ln n / ln 2 
(or log (base 2) n). Everytime n makes the whole number increase, it literaly
doubles the count.

Confusing if you dont graph.
