Take the stack class that we implemented in class and do the following with it:

0) Convert the stack class to a template stack class (the existing class only works with integers).

1) Provide functionality that will increase the size of the stack if we try to push an item onto an already full stack (resize the array).

2) Demonstrate the functionality of the template stack class with pushing/popping of integers, floats/doubles, strings, and even simple classes if you wish to be very creative!

Due by 4/29/16 @ 11:59PM - provide a completed PSP Spreadsheet or push to your github account with a minimum of three commits/pushes.
