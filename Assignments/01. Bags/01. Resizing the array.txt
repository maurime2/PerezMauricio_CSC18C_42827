Take the Bags project that was introduced in class and implement the following:

1: Resizing the array when the number of items exceeds the size of the array
	(no linked lists allowed - yet)

This should be a fairly quick and easy assignment, that is due no later than 
11:59PM on Thursday, March 3rd, 2016 via the Assignment Submission on 
Blackboard. Do document how you implemented the resizing of the array, how you
tested the method.

Include the properly filled out PSP 0.1 Excel Spreadsheet
remember, any assignments with less than one hour of work will not be accepted)
